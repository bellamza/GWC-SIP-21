# HTML

### Defining HTML

HTML \(Hypertext Markup Language\) is used to structure the content within a website. This is useful when creating websites because it not only makes it possible to display content such as text, images, videos, links, and so on, but it also helps keep everything organized and sectioned off. 

### Briefly Defining CSS\*

CSS \(Cascading Style Sheets\) is used to make the website look beautiful. Before implementing the CSS, a website looks more like a chunk of information. Coders \(you\) use CSS to take that chunk of information and display it in a way that helps the user \(people viewing your website\) digest the material effortlessly by making the website more visually appealing.
