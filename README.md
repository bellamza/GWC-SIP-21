# Introduction

## Welcome!

Welcome to my little hub of notes plus extra challenges and resources! Each section contains explanations, examples, and extra material you could use to further explore the topics we learned in session. I also included links to external resources and the GWC slides which will be located under the "Compilation of Resources" section of the notes for each topic. Each topic's notes also contain a "Challenge" section for those who want to explore topics further, and a "Tips on Getting Started" section to provide ideas for those who are unsure of where to start.

To get started, click on a topic of your choice from the navigation bar to the left.

Good Luck!
